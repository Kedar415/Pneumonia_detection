Detection of pneumonia  through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces  work of doctor, We have trained the model with the help of Inception_V3 Model which is the part of the convolution neural network  (CNN) Model.  When the Image or the x-ray is passed to model , the model can predict whether the patient has the pneumonia or not.
